# Nebula UI Framework
Nebula UI Framework, The official front-end framework for building experiences that fit seamlessly into ITWORX HUB.

## Philosophy
A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Nebulae are often star-forming regions In these regions the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter, and eventually will become dense enough to form stars.

**Nebula UI Framework** contains UI and JS Components so you can build your design, focus on your business and make your application looks like ITWORX HUB.
